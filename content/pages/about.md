I'm a computer science undergraduate at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ "BITS Pilani, Goa Homepage"). I like to do research as well as development work. 

I was a research fellow at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/ "MPI-SWS's Homepage")  in the Real Time Systems group under [Dr. Björn Brandenburg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/ "Björn's Homepage") , where I worked on formal analysis of real time systems. 

I was also a machine learning research intern at [CSIR-CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/ "CEERI Homepage") under [Dr. Sumeet Saurav](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/ "Sumeet's Homepage"), working broadly on explainable artificial intelligence for medical imaging applications. 

Here I blog about research, life, career and various topics in computer science that I find interesting.
